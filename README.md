# Poligraft by Sunlight Labs

A project funded by the Knight Foundation.

## Set up

This is a Rails 3 app, so make note of the required use of the `bundler` gem. Uses MongoDB for persistence.

If you have commit rights:

    git clone git@github.com:sunlightlabs/poligraft.git
    
Read-only:

    git clone git://github.com/sunlightlabs/poligraft.git

Install the required gems:
    
    bundle install
    
Note that the `script/xxx` methods are now replaced with the `rails` command.

    rails console
    rails server
